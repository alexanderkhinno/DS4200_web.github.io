    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Bitcoin is widely recognized for its extreme volatility—its price often moves not 
        because of traditional financial indicators, but because of investor psychology. 
        In this project, we analyze the relationship between Bitcoin’s historical price movements 
        and the Fear & Greed Index, a sentiment score ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). 
        Understanding this relationship is important because Bitcoin’s value isn’t tied to corporate earnings 
        or economic fundamentals. Instead, it is shaped by collective emotion, market momentum, and adoption 
        patterns. This makes Bitcoin a strong case study for exploring how sentiment influences financial 
        markets. Our goal was to visualize how Bitcoin’s price interacts with daily sentiment patterns and to 
        identify whether emotional highs and lows align with market turning points.</p>
    

    <h2>Bitcoin Fear & Greed Timeseries</h2>

    <div class="visualization-container">
        <iframe src="viz1_btc_fear_greed_timeseries.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
        <p>Our first visualization is an interactive chart that shows Bitcoin's daily closing price 
            alongside the daily Fear and Greed score. The chart uses a dual-axis format because price 
            values and sentiment values are on very different scales. The interactive timeline underneath 
            allows users to zoom in on specific periods, which makes it easier to see how price and sentiment 
            moved during rallies, crashes, or extended sideways markets. When exploring the chart, we noticed 
            that sentiment often reacts to price changes rather than predicting them. Fear tends to deepen after 
            a major drop, and greed tends to appear after prices have already risen. Extreme emotional levels 
            also appear close to major turning points, although the timing is not always perfect. When looking at 
            the long timeline, the broader cycles of price and sentiment line up with well-known bull and bear 
            phases in the Bitcoin market.</p>

    <h2>Sentiment & Volatility Scatterplot</h2>

    <div class="visualization-container">
        <iframe src="viz2_sentiment_vs_volatility.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
        <p>The second visualization compares seven-day average sentiment with seven-day rolling volatility. 
            Each point represents one day, and the color indicates the sentiment category. A year slider allows users 
            to explore the relationship during different periods. We used rolling averages to smooth out noisy day-to-day 
            changes and focus on overall patterns. From the scatter plot, we found that there is no simple or consistent linear 
            relationship between sentiment and volatility. High volatility can appear at both low and high sentiment scores. However, 
            we did notice that periods of extreme fear often show higher volatility, which matches common market behavior during panic 
            or rapid price drops. Neutral sentiment days tend to cluster at lower volatility levels. Greedy periods vary more, sometimes 
            appearing calm when prices are rising steadily and sometimes showing large swings when speculation is strong. Earlier years 
            appear more scattered and unpredictable, while more recent years show slightly more structure, which may suggest a maturing 
            market.</p>

    <h2>Monthly Sentiment Heatmap</h2>

    <div class="visualization-container">
        <img src="matplotlib_viz1_monthly_heatmap.png" alt="Monthly Sentiment Heatmap" width="100%">
        <p>The monthly sentiment heatmap shows the average Fear and Greed score for each month across several years. 
            Red represents lower sentiment values, yellow represents neutral values, and green represents higher sentiment levels. 
            Presenting the data in monthly form makes long-term emotional patterns easier to see than daily data, which can be very noisy. 
            From the heatmap, we noticed that certain months tend to lean consistently fearful or greedy, and clusters of extreme fear often 
            appear shortly before markets begin to recover. We also observed long stretches where sentiment stays mostly fearful or mostly greedy, 
            which align with extended bear and bull markets. In more recent years, the shifts between extreme fear and extreme greed appear less sharp, 
            which may reflect increased market stability or growing participation from institutional investors.</p>

    <h2>Candlestick Chart</h2>

    <div class="visualization-container">
        <img src="matplotlib_viz2_candlestick.png" alt="Candlestick Chart" width="100%">
        <p>The candlestick chart focuses on the most recent ninety days of Bitcoin trading data. 
            Each candle shows the daily open, close, high, and low prices. Behind the candles, 
            the background color reflects the sentiment category for that day. Combining price 
            action with sentiment shading makes it easier to see how emotion aligns with short-term 
            market movements. We found that extreme fear often appears near local price bottoms, while 
            extreme greed is frequently present near short-term highs. When sentiment changes quickly from 
            fear to greed or the other way around, price tends to show larger swings, suggesting that sharp 
            emotional shifts correspond to increased volatility. However, sentiment is not perfectly predictive. 
            There are periods when fear remains high even as prices begin to rise, and periods when greed persists 
            during small pullbacks. This shows that sentiment provides useful context but cannot be used as a 
            standalone indicator</p>
