    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Bitcoin is widely recognized for its extreme volatility—its price often moves not 
        because of traditional financial indicators, but because of investor psychology. 
        In this project, we analyze the relationship between Bitcoin’s historical price movements 
        and the Fear & Greed Index, a sentiment score ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). 
        Understanding this relationship is important because Bitcoin’s value isn’t tied to corporate earnings 
        or economic fundamentals. Instead, it is shaped by collective emotion, market momentum, and adoption 
        patterns. This makes Bitcoin a strong case study for exploring how sentiment influences financial 
        markets. Our goal was to visualize how Bitcoin’s price interacts with daily sentiment patterns and to 
        identify whether emotional highs and lows align with market turning points.</p>

    <h2>Monthly Sentiment Heatmap</h2>

    <div class="visualization-container">
        <img src="matplotlib_viz1_monthly_heatmap.png" alt="Monthly Sentiment Heatmap" width="100%">
        <ul>
            <li>This is our monthly sentiment heatmap, where each square represents one month and is colored by the average Fear & Greed score for that month.</li>
            <li>The visualization uses <strong>rectangular marks</strong>, and the main visual channel is <strong>color</strong>, ranging from red (fear) to green (greed).</li>
            <li>Text labels are added inside each cell to clearly show the exact monthly sentiment values.</li>
            <li>The heatmap reveals clear long-term sentiment cycles in the Bitcoin market.</li>
            <li>Clusters of red, fearful months often appear right before market recoveries.</li>
            <li>Greener months tend to align with sustained bull markets.</li>
            <li>In more recent years, swings between extreme fear and extreme greed appear less dramatic, suggesting increasing market stability or growing institutional influence.</li>
            <li>Overall, the heatmap highlights emotional patterns that are harder to see in daily data.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Candlestick Chart</h2>

    <div class="visualization-container">

        <ul>
            <li>This figure is our 90-day candlestick chart, where each candlestick is a bar-like mark encoding the daily open, high, low, and close prices.</li>
            <li>A sentiment layer is added behind the candles, using <strong>color</strong> as the channel to represent categories such as Extreme Fear, Neutral, and Greed.</li>
            <li>From this chart, we observed that sentiment often moves in parallel with short-term price behavior.</li>
            <li>Red, fearful background colors tend to appear near local price bottoms.</li>
            <li>Greener colors usually show up when the price begins trending upward.</li>
            <li>Rapid shifts from fear to greed often coincide with larger price movements.</li>
            <li>There are also cases where sentiment remains fearful even while price is already recovering, showing that sentiment is helpful context but not perfectly predictive.</li>
