    <h2>Our Data</h2>
    
    <h3>Bitcoin Price Data</h3>

    <p>The Bitcoin price dataset comes from Kaggle and originally contains minute-level trading records, 
        including the open, high, low, close, and volume for every minute. Since the dataset was too granular 
        for long-term analysis, we converted all Unix timestamps into standard dates and then aggregated every
        minute of data into daily summaries. Each day includes the opening price, the highest and lowest values, 
        the closing price, and the total trading volume. This produced a clean and consistent daily price 
        timeline that could be merged with the sentiment dataset.</p>

    <h3>Fear & Greed Sentiment Data</h3>
    
    <p>The sentiment dataset also comes from Kaggle and provides a daily Fear and Greed Index 
        score based on market volatility, momentum, survey responses, social media indicators, 
        and other demand factors. Each day also includes a sentiment category such as Extreme Fear, 
        Fear, Neutral, Greed, or Extreme Greed. After filling in missing values and aligning its 
        dates with the Bitcoin price data, this dataset gave us a complete and readable timeline 
        of daily market sentiment that we could directly pair with the daily price summaries.</p>

    <h2>What We Learned</h2>

    <p>Through our visualizations and analysis, we found that sentiment does relate to Bitcoin’s 
        price behavior, but the relationship is not simple or immediate. Sentiment provides valuable 
        context and helps explain why prices move the way they do, especially during emotionally charged 
        periods. Extreme fear and extreme greed often appear close to turning points, although not 
        always at the exact moment. We also saw clear emotional and price cycles over longer periods. 
        In addition, the market appears to be gradually maturing, with less dramatic sentiment 
        swings in more recent years. For investors, sentiment can help interpret the state of the 
        market, but it should not be used by itself and works best when combined with other 
        forms of analysis.</p>
    
    <h2>Future Work</h2>

    <p>If we were to expand this project, we would consider including additional forms of sentiment 
        data such as Twitter posts or Reddit discussions to see whether social-media-based sentiment 
        adds predictive value. We would also consider building machine-learning models that combine 
        sentiment, price, volatility, and other indicators to test whether they can predict future 
        price movements. Another possible direction would be analyzing Ethereum or other major 
        cryptocurrencies to compare whether their sentiment patterns behave similarly. Exploring 
        different timeframes, such as hourly or weekly data, could also reveal new patterns. 
        Finally, identifying market regimes such as bull markets, bear markets, or consolidation 
        phases could help us understand how sentiment interacts with price under different conditions.</p>
